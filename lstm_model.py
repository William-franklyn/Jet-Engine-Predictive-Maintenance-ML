"""
LSTM RUL regressor for NASA C-MAPSS FD001.

Why an LSTM at all: the linear/logistic/RF models see ONE cycle at a time —
a single row of 16 scaled sensor readings — and have to guess remaining life
from that snapshot. Degradation is a trajectory, so an LSTM that reads the
last SEQ_LEN cycles of an engine can use the *trend* (how fast sensor 11 is
drifting), not just the current value.

Windowing: for engine u and cycle t, the sample is rows [t-SEQ_LEN+1 .. t]
and the label is that engine's capped RUL at cycle t. Engines shorter than
SEQ_LEN cycles are left-padded with their first row (FD001's shortest engine
is 128 cycles, so this is just a safety net).

Trained/evaluated by compare_models.py. Nothing here reads or writes the
dashboard's model file — app.py is untouched.
